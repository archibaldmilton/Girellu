  "description": "The Viper was initially conceived in late 1988 at Chrysler&#39;s Advanced Design Studios. In 2000 Chrysler had Lamborghini make an engine two liters bigger than the Diablo&#226;€™s engine when Chrysler owned Lamborghini. It was also designed by the man who designed the Diablo. <br><br>The original Viper was also designed by Lamborghini. The following February, Chrysler president Bob Lutz suggested to Tom Gale at Chrysler Design that the company should consider producing a modern Cobra, and a clay model was presented to Lutz a few months later. Produced in sheet metal by Metalcrafters, the car appeared as a concept at the North American International Auto Show in 1989. Public reaction was so enthusiastic that chief engineer Roy Sjoberg was directed to develop it as a standard production vehicle.",
