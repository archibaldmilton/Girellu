	"description": "The AE86 generation of the Toyota Sprinter Trueno is a small, lightweight coupe or hatchback introduced by Toyota in 1983.<br><br>
	In classic Toyota code, the 'A' represents the engine that came in the car (4A series), 'E' represents the Corolla, '8' represents the fifth generation (E80 series) and '6' represents the variation within this generation.<br><br>
	Even after production of the car was discontinued in 1987, many privateer teams still raced the AE86, and it is still a popular choice for rallying and club races today.<br><br>
	Part of the continued appeal of the AE86 for motorsports is its rear-drive configuration, a feature not available in most newer lightweight coupes.",
