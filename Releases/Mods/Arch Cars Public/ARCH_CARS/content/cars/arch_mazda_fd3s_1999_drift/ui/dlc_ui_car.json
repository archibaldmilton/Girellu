	"description": "Because of its nature, the rotary engine is able to run at higher speeds without suffering the detrimental forces of a common engine. This means the owner is not forced to focus on extensive modifications to preserve engine's lifetime. <br><br>
The main steps are remapping the engine, replacing the original turbo system with a bigger unit, improving the air filter to have a higher flow (very important for rotary engines), exhaust pipe and, of course, installing a big rear wing because the rear is really light at high speeds.
