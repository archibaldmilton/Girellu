	"description": "Toyota Supra was one of the finest Japanese supercar: through tuning it easily reaches 600hp and can go over 1000hp.<br><br>It's revered as one of the most highly tuneable cars on the planet. The drift version has a smaller turbine that sacrifices a bit of high end power for a better turbo response with more torque in the mid range revs. Extra modifications on the suspension geometry for more steering lock and setup options are available.",
