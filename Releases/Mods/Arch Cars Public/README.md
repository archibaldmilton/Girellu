# Arch Modified Physics
> Minimum CSP version is 0.2.0
### Some takeaways from this Arch update:
* All Arch cars will eventually be updated to Cosmic suspension type. To know about more cosmic suspension type, click [here](https://github.com/ac-custom-shaders-patch/acc-extension-config/wiki/Cars-%E2%80%93-Cosmic-Suspension "GitHub").
* Non cosmic suspension data will be moved to the legacy folder for archival purposes and thereby will no longer receive support.
## Installation
The install_arch_cars.bat script will automate installing of the car mods inside this folder. If you want to individually download cars, then you will have to manually install them.
### Automated .bat script install (recommended method, installs all cars)
Run the install_arch_cars.bat script and follow instructions within. Any errors mean you are missing a mod or AC DLC content.
### Manual install (individual, per-car basis)
Follow the instructions inside the car folder's "!README AND INSTRUCTIONS.txt".

#### Additional Notes
* For other Arch mods, check [ARCH_OTHER.md](./ARCH_OTHER.md).
* If you want to use Arch physics for something else, refer to the [license](./LICENSE.md).
* Support is not promised; if there is a technical issue, it is user error.
* No guarantee for satisfactory user experience unless using appropriate professional simulation peripherals with [correct configuration](https://github.com/archibaldmilton/Girellu/wiki/AC-Startup-Guide#force-feedback-ffb).
